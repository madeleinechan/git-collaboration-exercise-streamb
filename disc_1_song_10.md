I'm so tired 
I haven't slip the wing
I'm so tired
My mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up
and fix myself a drink
no no no
I'm so tired
I don't know what to do
I'm so tired
My mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do
you changed, you??? is no joke
it's doing me harm you know what ???
I cast on my brain you know me three weeks
I'm going insane you know I'm giving you everything I've got for little piece of mine

I'm so tired
I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired
I have another cigarette
I'm cursed ??? in a such a stupid get

???
It's doing me harm you know I can't sleep
